# FLUX
<p>
The game consists of a single boss fight that is split into three stages, each presenting you with a unique set challenges.
The boss will use different special abilities against you during stages 1 and 3, while in stage 2 you must survive a deadly asteroid field.
<p>
However, not all is stacked against you! There are powerups to increase your damage output or regenerate your health, and a 'blink' ability can also be used every fifteen seconds to quickly teleport in a certain direction.
Useful for dodging projectiles or asteroids!
